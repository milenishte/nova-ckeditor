# Image Max Height

| Property Name | Type | Default |
| ------------- | ---- | ------- |
| max-height    | int  | 1080    |

The `max-height` configuration option allows you to specify the maximum height for images within the CKEditor field. This setting determines the maximum allowed height for uploaded images and ensures that they are automatically resized if their height exceeds this limit.

By default, the `max-height` configuration option is set to `768`, indicating a maximum height of 768 pixels. This helps maintain consistency and prevents excessively tall images from affecting the layout and performance of your application.

To configure the `max-height` option, update the value in the configuration file `config/nova-ckeditor.php` with the desired maximum height value.
